# fcnyvacom

This is the first design for the official website of the local football club fcnyva.com, which was launched in March 2014. The design and structure, with minor changes (the team changed the logo), existed in this form until December 2020. I came up with the structure of the site, wrote html, css code, connected scripts, draw online icons. Then another person screwed the php code to it. For me, it was a purely volunteer project. If they paid for it, it was clearly not me - a person with no experience who realized his own vision of a sports team website while studying html and css at the same time.
