# fcnyvacom

These are parts of the first design of the local football club's official website, fcnyva.com, which was launched in March 2014. The design and structure, with minor changes (the team changed the logo), existed in this form until December 2020. I came up with the structure of the site, wrote html, css code, connected scripts, and drew online icons. Then another person screwed the php code to it. Photos were posted in galleries and social networks, and only links to them were used on the website. Most of these photos were my first attempts at sports photography with an old manual lens. There was no reward from the club - it was a purely volunteer project. It was a good opportunity to realize one's own vision of a sports team website, while simultaneously practicing writing html and css.
