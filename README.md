# fcnyvacom

This is the parts of first design for the official website of the local football club fcnyva.com, which was launched in March 2014. The design and structure, with minor changes (the team changed the logo), existed in this form until December 2020. I came up with the structure of the site, wrote html, css code, connected scripts, drew online icons. Then another person screwed the php code to it. The photos in the galleries were posted on social networks, and only links to them are on the website. Most of those photos were my first attempts at sports photography with an old manual lens. For me, it was a purely volunteer project, I helped friends of my  brother. If club paid for it work, it was clearly not to me - a person with no experience who realized his own vision of a sports team website while studying html and css at the same time.
